# Basic-English-Word-Suggestion

In regards to finishing my COMP 2140 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in University of Manitoba,
  I made a simple project using hash table data structure in Java.
I intend to develop this project into a working auto-correct application,
  but for now, as I don't have the knowledge to make an application yet, this basic english word suggestion will do me some practice.

How it works:
  User will run the program in the console of the given main() file named Main_BEWS.java
  Input some random word and the program will be able to give some english word suggestions for one that is a typo/incorrect
